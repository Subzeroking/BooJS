# What is this?
**BooJS** allows you to execute javascript on the command line as if you were in a browser. It has well defined behavior that follows `unix` conventions and is built on-top of [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).

**BooJS** was purpose built for our continuous integration infrastructure at [FittrÂ®](http://www.fittr.com).

# Setup
```js
#Setup
gem install boojs
```

# Usage
#### SYNOPSIS
```js
boojs [-e statement] [-t timeout] [-v file] [file]
```

#### DESCRIPTION
The following options are available:
 * `-e` - Pass a javascript statement to execute after the file (if a file is provided) and then immediately terminate unless `-t` is set.
 * `-t` - Close the program after N seconds have passed, if an exception is raised before this, terminate immediately
 * `-v` - Verify that a file contains no javascript syntax errors. Returns 0 if there are no errors.

#### EXAMPLES
Open a javascript pipe that reads from stdin, writes via console.log to stdout, prints exceptions via stderr, and exits with a return code of 1 if there are errors.
```js
(sh)>boojs
console.log("Hello world!");           //Output to $stdout
console.error("Goodbye cruel world!"); //Output to $stderr
```

Same as `boojs` but read the javascript file before reading from stdin.  (i.e. preload a javascript file into your environment)
```js
(sh)>boojs jquery.js
$("body").html("<h1>Hello</h1>");
console.log($("body").html())
```

Execute a javascript statement, and then immediately exit. Exceptions will return 1.
```js
(sh)>boojs -e "console.log(document);"
```

Execute a javascript statement, and then wait 4 seconds before exiting. Exceptions will return 1 and end execution early.
```js
(sh)>boojs -e "console.log(document);" -t 4
```

Verify that a file contains no javascript runtime initialization errors
```js
(sh)>boojs -v code.js
(sh)>echo $?
0
```

#### NOTES
  * Calling `booPing()` will immediately return `"pong"` to `stdout`. You may use this to know when boo has started up fully.
  * `console.error(msg)` will output to `$stderr`.  `console.log(msg)` will output to `$stdout`.

## FAQ & Rants

### Wait, isn't this just NodeJS?
No, they are for different things. BooJS gives you the full DOM, you can call `document` in BooJS and import arbitrary browser javascript libraries.

### ...But PhantomJS has a perfectly good REPL, kids these days...
There are a myriad issues with the *PhantomJS repl*; most notably, the *PhantomJS repl*:
  * Outputs special format characters even when not attached to a `tty`
  * Does not have well defined behavior which makes it a nightmare to integrate with
  * **Has no support for asynchronous stdin**
  * Does not output `console.error` to `stderr`
  * Changes what it considers a newline based on the attached terminal (A QT quirk)
  * Is not a unix tool in any sense

I don't think any of this is the `PhantomJS`'s team fault; it's just not their focus or target.

### Why would I use BooJS over my browser console?
You wouldn't, if you preferred that.  *BooJS* was designed for continuous integration environments and has evolved into fun for shell scripting (i.e. `netcatesque`) and even dynamic website page analysis.  Some users also prefer CLI over GUI.

### ...Capistrano?
Capistrano is great for integration tests for behaviors; many users prefer to use both `BooJS` for the javascript layer and then `Capistrano` for behavioral testing, especially with frameworks like `cucumber`.  `BooJS` is faster to boot and and more determinant than `Capistrano` while `Capistrano` is able to verify behavior across browsers and visuals. They go well togeather.

### Why Ruby?
Ruby has many shortcomings; Nonetheless, ruby is an excellent language for writing tools in. Ruby has a culture of testing, a mature gem database that contains many *js* parsers, increadible syntax that includes N-embeddable strings within strings without ugly escape sequences, and good support for `POSIX` interfaces.

Did you know that *WebKit* uses *Ruby* to pre-compile it's bytecode interpreter *LLInt*? https://trac.webkit.org/browser/releases/Apple/Safari%206.0.2/JavaScriptCore/offlineasm

### When should I use boojs?
When you need to test javascript code that needs to run in a browser but don't necessarily need to test the UI components.
